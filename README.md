# Full Source Code for my django Blog

This repository is the entire source (sans sensitive DB credentials and stuff) for my blog, located at 
[alan.edward.es](http://alan.edward.es/).

## Why

I have been keeping my own [release notes](http://alan.edward.es/changelog/) for a while now, but it's pretty stupid that I haven't been versioning my code. So here it is.

## What It Does

My blog allows you to post using an admin panel, users to comment using my own front-end, live AJAX (AJAJ?) search, archiving, a contact form, YouTube embeds... and other stuff. It's a little messy in places, but fully functional.
